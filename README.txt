COMP-6936-ASSIGNMENT-1
==============================

Description: 

My Assignment is based on Local and Global Interpretability of GAM.
The assignment consists of 2 main parts:

In assignment1_part1, I first applied GAM to predict future Prices of EURUSD. 
I then proceeded to explain this model Locally using LIME.

In assignment2_part2, I first removed the features from the data that were found to
have no influence on prediction, and applied SP-LIME to explain the model globally.

The Data used for this assignment is in the file EURUSD_RATES.csv.
